## Description

I wanted to create a simple program for writing, updating, and deleting employee information from a SQL database.
It solves the need of having to rewrite common SQL statements by using inquirer prompts to write SQL statements for you.
After completing this project, I feel much more comfortable with SQL including using joins and foreign keys.
